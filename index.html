    <h1 id="years">1998</h1>
    <p>Born in Milwaukee, WI, in 1998. Life was great, but as I grew older, my hatred for snow grew as well. After graduating high school, I held several jobs, and they were all easy to get into through staffing agencies. One day you need a job, and the next day they have one for you. Many of my jobs early on were because I had friends working there, so it was a no-brainer. Getting paid to essentially hang out with friends was an easy decision.</p>
    <p>In 2018, I went to community college for marketing, luckily debt-free, but I can't say if it was really worth the time looking back at it. Because of COVID, my upcoming internships were canceled. It has been hard to find an entry-level job in the field, even though a handful of people tried to connect me with the right people.</p>

    <h1 id="years">2021</h1>
    <p>Moving to Louisiana in 2021, I would find out how different things are between the north and the south. When it comes to employment, I noticed that when it comes to getting a manufacturing job, the times are very different. In Wisconsin, I could easily find a factory job working 6 am to 2 pm, which is a very normal shift there. All factory jobs in Louisiana are much later, from 12 pm to 8 pm</p>
    <p>Also in Louisiana, the majority of people either work in the oil field or offshore. If you were to tell people in Wisconsin that you work on boats, they would be extremely confused. The most common response was, "you get paid to fish?"</p>
